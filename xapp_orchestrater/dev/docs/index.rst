Welcome to O-RAN SC Integratoin for xApp Development Documentation
==================================================================

The it/dev repo is used by the O-RAN SC Integration and Testing project for hosting miscellaneous development codes.
This repo contains integration artifacts for developing Near Realtime RAN Intelligent Controller applications (xApps).

Because the life cycles of Near Realtime RIC xApps are managed by Near Realtime RIC
Platform, the xApps are expect to conform with certain behavioral patterns and provide
well-described interfaces.  The artifacts here help the xApp developers to generate (Near Realtime) RIC Platform deployment ready Helm charts for their xApps.


The following is a list of projects hosted by this repo.
